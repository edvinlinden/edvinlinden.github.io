    <h1 class="mb-2 text-center sm:text-left">What I learned by launching my first app</h1>
    <div class="mb-8 text-xs text-center sm:text-left">10 juli 2021</div>
    <p>Ever since I started to learn how to build things for computers I have followed blogs, newsletters and forums where people make incredible <em>things</em>.</p>
<p>Some <em>things</em> are just for fun, like Rafael Conde's <a href="http://breakthissafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Break This Safe</a> that inspired my own game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-impossible-safe/id1573468310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impossible Safe</a>, and others are the start of new businesses.</p>
<p>I've always watched these people with a feeling of &quot;I want to do that, I want to make <em>things</em>&quot;. However this year something changed. It went from feelings to actions to an actual launched app.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of COVID or maybe I was tired of starting making <em>things</em> but never completing them, who knows.</p>
<p>During christmas last year I launched Xcode on my MacBook as I had many times before without actually completing any projects, but this time I was determined to actually launcing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-box-timer/id1547518531">my app</a>.</p>
<h2>Making the app was the easy part</h2>
<p>The app that I was going to make was pretty simple, a workout timer that works like the one I have at my gym. This would solve both my &quot;I want to make <em>things</em>&quot; problem but also my problem of not having a good workout timer for workouts at home or outside during COVID.</p>
<p>Due to my lack of follow through on previous projects I've started, I actually had pretty little knowledge about how to build and launch an app.</p>
<p>I got some experience with bulding things for the web, but Swift is not a language I speak fluently. Luckily for me it's pretty simple and there's a lot of tutorials out there.</p>
<p>Building a timer, with some settings and a specific look and feel was not that complicated, plenty of people had done it before.</p>
<p>There was very good references, <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/">Hacking with Swift</a> and YouTube being my go to ones, to use for how to build each feature I wanted to have in the app.</p>
<h2>Smooth sailing to the App Store</h2>
<p>I've heard about the Apple review process, the rules and general pain of getting apps onto the App Store. But when I acutally went through each step it was a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Apple have done a really great job with making the process feel seamless. It goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload your app to Apple's App Store Connect from Xcode</li>
<li>Enter all details about the app, upload all marketing images and so on in App Store Connect</li>
<li>Press publish</li>
</ol>
<p>I know there's a lot of things that can complicate the review process, but for small simple apps like mine it really is a really good experience.</p>
<h2>Getting users is really hard</h2>
<p>So I had done it, this time I actually followed through on a project. And I have a published app in the App Store to prove it.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>How do I get people to use it? I asked all my friends to try it out of course, but that only goes so far.</p>
<h4>Product Hunt</h4>
<p>I <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/the-box-timer">launched on Product Hunt</a>, a community where people all over the world share new and interesting products, with some success, 130 upvotes and 29 app installs.</p>
<h4>Apple Search Ads</h4>
<p>Apple give new developers $100 in credits to use on Apple Search Ads, that's an offer you can't refuse. I blew it all over the course of two months.</p>
<p>I went with the Basic version of Search Ads where Apple magically select who the audience of the ad should be and when to show it. Maybe I could have got a better result withe the Advanced version, but I didn't have the energy to learn all about it.</p>
<p>The Search Ads resulted in about 250-300 app installs, that's of course amazing with it being free and all. But if I was to pay for it the price would have been around 30-40 cents per app installs. That's not a sustainable growth method for a free app built as a side project.</p>
<h4>Instagram</h4>
<p>With the price for Apple Search Ads in mind I went to my next growth idea. An idea all based on me hearing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/garyvee">Gary Vee</a> go on and on about how you should just spend time commenting and following on Instagram.</p>
<p>I will admit that I don't really like this growth method, but it worked really well!</p>
<p>To ease my conscience and not feel like a complete spam bot I decided to deliver value on Instagram as well using it as a marketing tool. This plan would also give me an excuse to stay relevant to the followers on Instagram.</p>
<p>First I created an account on Instagram(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/theboxtimer/">@theboxtimer</a>) and converted it to a business account, this gave me access to statistics, marketing and other business features.</p>
<p>Then I created a few images to use as promotion for my app both in posts and in stories. This would be the foundation of the actual marketing of the app.</p>
<p>The additional value I would bring to Instagram was workouts(WODs), a simple post with a workout you could do at home or outside and using the app at the same time.</p>
<p>Each day I posted a new workout and with a few days in between I posted one of the marketing images. This let me reach the followers on a regular basis without spamming them with marketing material.</p>
<p>But just posting alone won't give you any followers though, this is where the Gary Vee part comes in. I went full on hustle mode and started commenting, liking and following all around the Instagram fitness bubble.</p>
<p>It was a bit slow in the start, but after a while I got a lot of followers. Not just &quot;follow for follow&quot; type of follows but actual real users that liked both the app and the workouts.</p>
<p>As of today Instagram has resulted in over 500 app installs and the account got over 4 000 followers.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The process of taking an idea and making it a reality, no matter how small it is, is really fun and rewarding. It beats just thinking about all day!</p>
<p>It's really hard to get people to use your <em>thing</em>! But the feeling you get when they do is amazing.</p>
<p>Interested in the app I made? It's called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-box-timer/id1547518531">The Box Timer</a></p>
