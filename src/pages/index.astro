        We all know about the Google Graveyard, the list of products that Google
        have discontinued through the years.

      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        While stumbling over a graveyard dedicated for Microsoft I was inspired
        to create a page where discontinued products from all major tech
        companies where listed.

        A safe cracking game for iPhone inspired by the Apple Watch game Break
        This Safe from Rafael Conde.

      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        The project was my second one using Swift and it's based around the
        haptic feedback in the iPhone. By feeling different vibrations you'll be
        able to find the correct combination to the safe.

        2020 was a strange year to say the least, it forced a lot of us to
        workout at home or outside. Due to the situation I went looking for a
        good workout timer to keep track of my workouts.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        All the apps I tested was either too complicated, bloated with features
        or had way too many ads(let's face it, no one likes ads). So I took it
        upon myself to create a simple workout timer, free from ads and
        unnecessary features.
