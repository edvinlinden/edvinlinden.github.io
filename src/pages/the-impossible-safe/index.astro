    A few years ago I saw Rafael Conde's <a
      href="http://breakthissafe.com/"
      title="Break This Safe"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Break This Safe</a
    >, but when I got to try it for myself it didn't seem to work as intended.
    Maybe a couple WatchOS releases broke something vital for the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    However the concept stuck in my head and when I created my first iPhone App,
    The Box Timer, I tought that "hey, this is probably something I can pull
    off".
  </p>
  <p>
    With my newfound confidence I spent a couple of weekends hacking away,
    trying to build something that was both fun and simple enought for me to
    actually complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result is the game you see today â€“ enjoy it as much as I did creating
    it!
