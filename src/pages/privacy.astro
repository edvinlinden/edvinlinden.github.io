        I want to process as little personal information as possible when you
        use my website. That's why I've chosen Fathom Analytics for my website
        analytics, <mark>which doesn't use cookies</mark> and complies with the GDPR,
        ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA and CCPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this privacy-friendly website analytics software, your IP address
        is only briefly processed, and <mark
          >I have no way of identifying you</mark
        >. As per the CCPA, your personal information is de-identified. You can
        read more about this on <a

        The purpose of me using this software is to understand my website
        traffic in the most privacy-friendly way possible so that I can
        continually improve my website. The lawful basis as per the GDPR is "f);
        where our legitimate interests are to improve our website and business
        continually." As per the explanation, no personal data is stored over
        time.
