      I want to process as little personal information as possible when you use
      my website. That's why I've chosen TelemetryDeck for my website analytics.

    <p>
      The purpose of me using this software is to understand my website traffic
      in the most privacy-friendly way possible so that I can continually
      improve my website. The lawful basis as per the GDPR is "f); where our
      legitimate interests are to improve our website and business continually."
      As per the explanation, no personal data is stored over time.
