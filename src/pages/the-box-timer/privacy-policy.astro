  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>Updated March 11, 2024</p>
  <p>
    The privacy policy of The Box Timer is very simple – I do not collect any
    personal information about you!
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that privacy should be protected. The best way to protect it is to
    share as little as possible. In order for me to operate the app and for you
    to use it there's no need to share any personal information. It's <i>just</i
    > a timer after all.
  </p>
  <p>
    I may update the Privacy Policy, you are advised to review this page
    periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
    the new Privacy Policy on this page.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to
    contact me at help@boxtimer.app
