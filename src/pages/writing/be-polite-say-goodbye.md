A few days ago when going through <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dribbble</a> I found <a href="https://www.kshitij.ws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kshitij</a>. His site had a feature that has been stuck in my head, he said goodbye when I left his site. I know â€“ ðŸ¤¯

So how did he do it? He used a thing we all hate about the web, the <i>"Subscribe for 10% off your next purchase!"</i> popup. Or as we call it in the industry, an exit intent popup. But he used it with no other purpose than to say goodbye, and that's really nice!

I've implemented a version of it on my site as well, you can see how it works by moving your mouse outside of the browser window. If you are reading this on a phone, here is a GIF showing it in action.
