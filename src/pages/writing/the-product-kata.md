It's been a few years since I first read <a href="https://melissaperri.com/book?ref=edvinlinden.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Escaping the Build Trap by Melissa Perri">Escaping the Build Trap by Melissa Perri</a>. Melissa covers a wide array of topics regarding how to manage products "the right way", one of the things that I really liked was <a href="https://melissaperri.com/blog/2015/07/22/the-product-kata?ref=edvinlinden.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Product Kata by Melissa Perri">the Product Kata</a>.

The elevator pitch goes something along these lines; <mark>Figure out the direction we are heading, then analyze where we are today, pick a target that move us in the right direction then experiment until we start moving towards the target.</mark>

The actual outputs from product management are roadmaps, product requirements and if you are lucky some organized user research. However that's artifacts that I think are more in line with a developers code commits or pull requests.

I have noticed that the Product Kata give us as product managers a way to track our work as we do it, similar to a scrum or kanban board. This is not only great for our own sanity but also an amazing way to discuss and get feedback from your colleagues.

No matter if it's a softare engineer, a sales agent or a manager – they all can understand the current condition of the product, the target condition and what you think should be the next move.

If you want to give it a go I really think you should read the book to understand the principles and the framework, if you are a product mangager I am sure you are going to love it!

I've created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1125835185318020169?ref=edvinlinden.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="FigJam template for Product Kata">FigJam template for Product Kata</a> so that you hit the ground running.
