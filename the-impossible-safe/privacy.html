                Cookies
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These
            are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The App does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
            libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
            either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
            refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this The App.

                Service Providers
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate The App;</li>
            <li>To provide The App on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our The App is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I want to inform users of The App that these third parties have access to your Personal Information.
            The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
            disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
        </p>

            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

        <p>
            The App may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
            that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review
            the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
            privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

        <p>
            The App do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable

            me with personal information, I immediately delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I
            will be able to perform necessary actions.
